## Pytorch implementation of Memory Augmented Neural Network(Santoro et al.)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Basic Implementation of MANN using LSTM
- [ ] Fix Training loss error
- [ ] Training for:-
    - 5 shot 1 way
    - 1 shot 5 way
- [ ] Use Bi-LSTM/multi layered LSTM
- [ ] Use NTM module

#### Loss stalls at 1.609 and Accuracy is very low(~20%)
